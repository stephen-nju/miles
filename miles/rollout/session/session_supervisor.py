"""Supervisor / lifecycle for the multi-process session server (workers > 1).

Spawns N headless workers + 1 thin router under a multiprocessing **spawn**
context, wires one ``socket.socketpair()`` per worker (worker-end to the worker,
router-end to the router), waits until ALL workers are ready (the router's
``/health`` reports every worker healthy), and then monitors the children:

* fail-fast — on ANY child death the whole group is killed and the failure is
  surfaced to the caller (a background thread cannot ``raise`` into the main
  rollout path, so it sets a flag the caller polls / the next launch observes);
* no orphans — SIGTERM / ``atexit`` / crash all route through one group kill, and
  every child sets ``PR_SET_PDEATHSIG=SIGKILL`` so a parent crash reaps them too.

The workers=1 path does NOT use this module; it stays a single
``run_session_server`` process with no router / IPC (see ``router_manager``).
