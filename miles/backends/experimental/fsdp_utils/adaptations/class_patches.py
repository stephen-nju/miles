"""HuggingFace-version compatibility patches for the experimental FSDP backend.

The FSDP backend trains the stock HuggingFace model, so it is sensitive to
transformers-version drift. These patches keep the training forward runnable and warn
on architectures whose forward diverges from the SGLang rollout. All are idempotent and
no-op when the underlying issue is absent.
