"""Unified packed-sequence layout handling for the FSDP backend.

One registry + one boundary derivation behind which each stateful arch registers how it resets
per-document state under THD packing. The actor calls ``apply_packing`` once per lifetime
(config-time class patches; post-load instance patches) instead of per-arch if-chains, and new
archs plug in by registering a ``PackingPatch`` in ``specs/`` (or registering nothing when the
arch packs natively). See ``boundaries.PackedSeqContext`` for the shared cu_seqlens/seq_idx.
