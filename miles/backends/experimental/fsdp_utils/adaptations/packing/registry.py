"""Registry that unifies packed-sequence layout handling across FSDP-backend architectures.

Stateful archs (GatedDeltaNet, Mamba2 hybrid, ...) each need to reset their per-document state
under THD packing, but they hook different methods/kernels. Rather than a hardcoded
``if "nemotron_h" in model_type: ...`` in the actor plus a separate ModelPatchHook for GDN, every
packing arch registers a ``PackingPatch`` here and the actor dispatches once per lifetime. Archs
that pack register a patch; archs that need nothing (e.g. ``glm4_moe_lite``, whose MLA already does
native HF varlen via FlashAttentionKwargs) simply don't — ``apply_packing`` is a no-op for them.
All patches share the one boundary derivation in ``boundaries.py``.

This is the third FSDP-backend registry, alongside ``weight_bridge`` (train->rollout param
contract) and ``hf_compat_patches.ModelPatchHook`` (config-time HF-compat patches); a new arch
plugs into a registry instead of editing a sync/patch/dispatch loop.

Two lifetimes, because the archs patch at different times:
  * ``"config"``    — patch the transformers *classes* before model construction (GatedDeltaNet
                      patches ``DecoderLayer``/``GatedDeltaNet`` class forwards); ``apply()`` takes
                      no model.
  * ``"post_load"`` — patch the *instantiated* model after ``from_pretrained`` (NemotronH's remote
                      ``trust_remote_code`` modeling needs the live module tree to find the Mamba2
                      mixer + attention classes); ``apply(model)`` takes the model.
