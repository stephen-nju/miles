# Fault Tolerance E2E Tests

## Layout

Each scenario's logic lives in a library module `conftest_ft/scenario_<scenario>.py`. CI
runs it through thin **per-mode entry files** `test_trainer_ft_<scenario>_<mode>.py` — one
mode each, registered with `register_cuda_ci(est_time=..., suite="stage-c-8-gpu-h200",
labels=["ft"])`. The CUDA CI runner executes each entry as bare `python3 <file>` (exit code
= pass/fail), so the entry just calls the scenario's `run_ci(mode)`.

| Scenario (`conftest_ft/scenario_*.py`) | Type | What it verifies |
|------|------|-----------------|
| `scenario_no_failure` | Comparison | indep_dp matches normal DP when no faults |
| `scenario_with_failure` | Comparison, multi-phase | indep_dp matches normal DP after fault + ckpt resume |
| `scenario_deterministic` | Comparison, multi-phase | healing state transfer is bitwise-correct (stop+start) |
| `scenario_ft_random` | Non-comparison | system survives random crashes without hanging |

## Mode Variants

Each scenario runs with a `--mode`:

All modes are **disaggregated** (training and rollout on separate nodes). Modes without rollout use debug rollout data.

| Mode | Nodes | DP cells | Batch | Parallelism | Rollout | Model | Coverage |
|------|-------|----------|-------|-------------|---------|-------|----------|
| `dp2_cp2_tp2_ep2` | 1 | 2 | 3 | CP2 TP2 EP2 | debug data | 5-layer MoE | TP + EP |
| `dp2_cp2_pp2` | 1 | 2 | 3 | CP2 PP2 | debug data | 5-layer MoE | PP |
| `dp4_cp2` | 1 | 4 | 5 | CP2 | debug data | 5-layer MoE | Multi-replica (>=4 cells) |
| `dp2_cp2_real_rollout` | 1 | 2 | 3 | CP2 | 4 engines × 1 GPU | 5-layer MoE | Real weight update path (no_failure, deterministic) |
| `dp2_cp2_real_rollout_dense` | 1 | 2 | 3 | CP2 | 4 engines × 1 GPU | dense Qwen3-0.6B | Real on-policy rollout under a fault (with_failure) |
| `6node_dp4_cp2_tp2_pp2_ep2_etp2` | 4+2 | 4 | 5 | CP2 TP2 PP2 EP2 ETP2 | 2 engines × 8 GPU | full MoE | Large-scale, all parallelism |

Batch sizes are deliberately **not** divisible by num_cells to test uneven sample distribution across replicas (e.g. DP4 + batch 5 → 2,1,1,1).

The 1-node modes use the truncated 5-layer MoE model (`Qwen3-30B-A3B-5layer`), except
`dp2_cp2_real_rollout_dense`, which uses a small real dense model (`Qwen3-0.6B`). The dense
model is used by `with_failure` so the ulp-level weight drift inherent to the post-crash
degraded-quorum commit is not amplified into token divergence by an uncalibrated truncated
MoE model under live generation — see the `scenario_with_failure` definition below.

Authorized CI skips (no entry file): `6node_dp4_cp2_tp2_pp2_ep2_etp2` (multi-node) and `with_failure × dp4_cp2`.

## Running

### In CI

The FT entries are gated on the `run-ci-ft` PR label (FT is expensive — it does not run on
every PR). With that label set, every `test_trainer_ft_<scenario>_<mode>.py` runs on the
`stage-c-8-gpu-h200` suite. To add a new `(scenario, mode)` to CI, add an entry file (copy
an existing one and change `run_ci(...)`'s mode). To add a brand-new label, edit
`tests/ci/labels.py` and create the matching `run-ci-<label>` GitHub label.

### Manually

Set `PYTHONPATH` to the repo root (CI sets it automatically). Two ways:

1. One mode, exactly as CI runs it — invoke the entry file:

   ```bash
   PYTHONPATH=. python tests/e2e/ft/test_trainer_ft_no_failure_dp2_cp2_tp2_ep2.py
   ```

2. Any mode (incl. the authorized-skip ones) — invoke the scenario's typer app with a
   subcommand:

   | subcommand | does |
   |---|---|
   | `run` | full pipeline: prepare + baseline + target + compare |
   | `baseline` / `target` | run one side only (debugging) |
   | `compare` | re-run comparison on existing dumps (no GPU) |

   ```bash
   PYTHONPATH=. python tests/e2e/ft/conftest_ft/scenario_<name>.py run --mode <mode>
   ```

   When debugging a failure, prefer the individual subcommands (with a shared `--dump-dir`,
   and `--phase` for multi-phase scenarios) over `run`, so you only re-run the part you
   changed and reuse what already passed — e.g. re-run just `compare` (no GPU) on existing
   dumps, or re-run a single side / phase.

   `scenario_ft_random` is non-comparison: only `run`, with `--seed` / `--num-steps` /
   `--crash-probability`. Each scenario's modes, phases, and knobs are in Mode Variants and
   Test Definitions.

Dumps are written under `/node_public/dumps/<test_name>/` (see `conftest_ft/app.py`
`resolve_dump_dir`).

## Comparison criterion

Dumps use per-tensor boolean predicates over `rel`/`max_abs`/`mean_abs`
(`compare_dumps(diff_thresholds=[(name_regex, predicate), ...])`): the deterministic
scenario requires bitwise equality (`rel <= 0`), which relies on both
`--deterministic-mode` (kernel determinism) and `--debug-deterministic-collective`
(fixed-tree SUM collectives). Metrics are also compared at `rtol=atol=0`, except
`train/grad_norm` (`rtol<=1e-6`): its bracketing depends on the distributed-optimizer
shard count (8 flat vs 2 per cell), so a few fp32 ulps are inherent, while the grads
themselves stay bitwise-checked via the dumps. Every other scenario allows a small
relative diff (`rel <= 0.0085`, with_failure also flooring near-zero MoE-expert and
QK-norm (`q_layernorm`/`k_layernorm`) grads at `max_abs <= 1e-3`). Unmatched tensors are a fail-closed error, so end each list with a `.*`
catch-all. Exact per-scenario thresholds are in Test Definitions below.

## Debug Rollout Data

Modes without rollout engines (`has_real_rollout == False`) use pre-recorded rollout data via `--load-debug-rollout-data --debug-train-only`, skipping real rollout generation.

`conftest_ft/execution.py` `prepare()` downloads the data via `U.hf_download_dataset()`.

### How to regenerate

The debug rollout data **must** be generated using the 5-layer model (not the full model).
Using the full model produces `rollout_log_probs` incompatible with the 5-layer training model,
causing NaN gradients in GRPO training.

```bash
# Step 1: Generate rollout data (5-layer model + real sglang rollout, no dumper)
PYTHONPATH=. python tests/e2e/ft/conftest_ft/scenario_no_failure.py generate-data \
    --mode dp2_cp2_real_rollout --num-steps 12 --output-dir /tmp/gen_rollout

# Step 2: Locate the generated rollout data
ls /tmp/gen_rollout/rollout_data/

# Step 3: Upload to HF
huggingface-cli upload --repo-type dataset fzyzcjy/miles-test-rollout-Qwen3-30B-A3B-5layer \
    /tmp/gen_rollout/rollout_data/
```

## Test Definitions

### `scenario_no_failure`

Comparison test. Verifies indep_dp produces the same results as normal DP when no faults occur.

```
Type: comparison (baseline=normal DP, target=indep_dp)
Steps: 2

1. Baseline: run normal DP training with debug rollout data
2. Target: run indep_dp training with the same data
3. Compare:
   - Tensor-level: compare_dumps (weights, grads via dumper & sglang comparator), rel <= 0.0085
   - Metric-level: compare_metrics (MetricEvent, requires train/grad_norm and train/loss)

Roughly equal, not bitwise — allreduce kernel ordering differs across topologies.
```

### `scenario_with_failure`

Multi-phase comparison test. Verifies indep_dp matches normal DP after fault + checkpoint resume.

```
Type: comparison, multi-phase (phase_a + phase_b)
Phase A steps: 1, Phase B steps: 4, metrics rtol: 5e-2

Phase A (both baseline and target):
  1. Run 1 step of training
  2. Save checkpoint (--save-interval 1)

Phase B — baseline:
  1. Resume from phase_a checkpoint
  2. Run 4 normal steps

Phase B — target:
  1. Resume from phase_a checkpoint
  2. Rollout 1: N cells normal
  3. Rollout 2, attempt 0: crash_before_allreduce on last cell rank 0
     → os._exit(1) → allreduce timeout → should_commit=false → retry
  4. Rollout 2, attempt 1: _refresh_cells() reconfigure → N-1 cells → commit
  5. After rollout 2: stop_cell_at_end(last) + start_cell_at_end(last)
  6. Rollout 3: _refresh_cells() healing → N cells
  7. Rollout 4: N cells stable

Compare: phase_b dumps (rel <= 0.0085; MoE expert grads and QK-norm grads also
tolerate max_abs <= 1e-3) and metrics (rtol=5e-2).

Fault injection via --ci-ft-test-actions JSON (data-driven, executed by RayTrainGroup).
The JSON `at_rollout` field specifies which rollout_id triggers the action.
The `attempt` field (for actor-level actions like `crash_before_allreduce`) specifies which retry attempt to match.
```

The `dp2_cp2_real_rollout_dense` mode runs this scenario with live on-policy generation
(real sglang engines, deterministic inference, temperature 0.8) on a small real dense model
(`Qwen3-0.6B`) instead of the truncated 5-layer MoE model. Rationale: the post-crash
degraded-quorum commit accumulates microbatches in a different floating-point bracketing than
the fault-free side — a fault-inherent ulp-level weight difference no collective ordering
removes. A fully-trained dense model keeps that drift small (calibrated peaky logits, no MoE
router near-ties), while keeping rollout, update_weights and the crash→retry→heal path all
real. The MoE expert-grad floor in the threshold list is inert on the dense model (no experts)
and applies only to the MoE debug-data modes of this scenario.

Comparison scope under live generation: even ulp-level weight drift can flip individual
sampled tokens (measured: `input_ids` of the first post-fault rollout differ between the
faulted and fault-free runs), so the training data of post-fault rollouts diverges between
the two sides and their gradients/activations have no equality contract. The first post-fault
rollout therefore compares only the dumped weights (the state produced by the recovery
commit, captured before that rollout's own update — the actual recovery-correctness
contract) plus the regular metric comparison; everything up to and including the crash
rollout stays fully strict, and rollouts further past the fault would not be comparable at
all (the comparison fails closed if the phase layout ever produces one). Debug-data modes
replay identical data on both sides, so all rollouts stay fully strict there.

### `scenario_deterministic`

Multi-phase comparison test. Verifies healing state transfer is **bitwise** correct.

```
Type: comparison, multi-phase (phase_a + phase_b)
Phase A steps: 1, Phase B steps: 3
Comparison: dump rel <= 0 (bitwise), metrics rtol=0 / atol=0 (exact)

Phase A: same as with_failure (1 step + save ckpt).

Phase B — target timeline:
  1. Rollout 1, 2: all N cells normal (2 good steps, accumulate meaningful state)
  2. After rollout 2: stop_cell_at_end(last) + start_cell_at_end(last) — trigger healing
  3. Rollout 3: healing at start (recv_ckpt from cell_0), then normal execution

Both baseline and target use --deterministic-mode + env vars (NCCL_ALGO=Ring,
NVTE_ALLOW_NONDETERMINISTIC_ALGO=0, CUBLAS_WORKSPACE_CONFIG=:4096:8) for kernel
determinism, plus --debug-deterministic-collective so every order-sensitive SUM
collective uses a fixed-tree fold and the different reduction topologies of normal DP
(baseline) and indep_dp (target) become bitwise-comparable. Together they make the run
fully deterministic, so healing must reproduce the no-fault baseline bit-for-bit. A
state-copy bug is easy to make and an approximate check would miss it, hence zero tolerance.

Bitwise verification: --use-fault-tolerance --ft-components train auto-enables
--save-local-weight-checksum and --enable-event-analyzer. The event_analyzer
cross_replica_weight_checksum rule checks cell-to-cell bitwise equality after healing.
```

### `scenario_ft_random`

Non-comparison soak test. Verifies the system survives random crashes without hanging.

```
Type: non-comparison (no baseline, no compare)
Steps: 30 (default), configurable via --num-steps

Architecture (external fault injection, not inside training loop):
  1. Start training with indep_dp + control server (port 18080) + mini FT controller
  2. Start a background daemon thread that:
     a. Sleeps a random interval (exponential distribution, mean ~60s / crash_probability)
     b. GET /api/v1/cells — discover alive cells
     c. Pick a random alive cell (skip if <=1 alive)
     d. POST /api/v1/cells/{name}/inject-fault with random failure mode
     e. Repeat until training finishes
  3. The actor's inject_fault() runs in a dedicated ray concurrency group thread
     and kills the process immediately (SIGKILL, os._exit, or segfault)
  4. Health checker detects dead actor via heartbeat timeout
  5. Mini FT controller auto-recovers (suspend → resume)
  6. Verify: training completes, no hangs, prod assertions pass

CLI options: --seed (default 42), --num-steps (default 30), --crash-probability (default 0.1)
```
